TRANSITIONS are classes which tell a macro when it can and should
transition away from a given behavior and which new behavior it should
transition to.  There are two classes here:

	- Basic TRANSITIONS, which you can hard-code however you like

	- LEARNABLE TRANSITIONS, which gather examples, and then learn
	  decision trees (or other classifiers in theory) from those
	  examples to provide the behaviors (classes) to transition to.
