FEATURES provide the current values of interesting features of various TARGETS.
Features can be associated with a variety of targets: for example, a feature
might be "direction to", and can be associated with the target "closest obstacle",
the target "mouse pointer", or even the abstract target "parameter A".

Features provide single values.  There are three kinds of features:

	- CATEGORICAL FEATURES provide integers from a range 1..n which represent
	  individual possible categories.  For example, a categorical feature might
	  be "status" and be one of "happy", "sad", or "disgruntled".  Categorical
	  features include boolean features ("true" and "false") as a subset, where
	  n = 2.

	- REAL VALUED FEATURES provide real numbers in a range from min ... max.
	  For example, "distance to" is a real valued feature.  The FEATURE class
	  is both the superclass of all features and also the default real-valued
	  feature abstract class.

	- TOROIDAL FEATURES provide real numbers in a range from min ... max, where
	  it is presumed that max and min are right next to each other (it's a loop).
	  For example, "angle to" is a real-valued feature whose values run from
	  0 ... just under 360.
