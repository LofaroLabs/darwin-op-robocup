The OBJECTS package contains most kinds of targetables, except for the Agent,
which display themselves on-screen in one fashion or another.  Such 
targetables include:

1. BODIES are shapes which represent regions on-screen or obstacles to the agent.
   You can make arbitrary-shape bodies, but two are available for you automatically,
   namely rectangular and circular bodies.  Bodies typically form obstacles in
   the HORDE class, but can also form regions (non-colliding areas) in the HORDE
   class as well.

2. MARKERS are single 2D points, displayed as little "X"s, in the Horde screen.
