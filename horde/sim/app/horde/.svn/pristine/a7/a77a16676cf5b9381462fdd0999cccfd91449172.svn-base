### AGENT CLASS
class = sim.app.horde.scenarios.forage.agent.Supervisor
shape = square
scale = 2.0

### TYPES
# I have defined two types already:
# global	Things that show up in every Horde agent
# sim		Things that show up in basic sim agents

# Here we state that we will use both global and sim types
num-types = 3
type.0 = global
type.1 = sim
type.2 = supervisor

#### If I were a homogeneous controller agent, I might say:
num-subs = 1
sub.0 = Forager
sub.0.min = 1
sub.0.max = 5
sub.0.pref = 5
