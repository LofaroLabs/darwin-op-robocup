BEHAVIORS manipulate the agent in some way.  Behaviors are divided into two basic
categories:

	- BASIC BEHAVIORS are hard-coded manipulators.

	- MACROS are finite-state automata whose states are other behaviors.
	  Importantly, TRAINABLE MACROS are Macros whos transition functions
	  are decision trees based on FEATURES of the environment.

Trainable macros, once learned, are serialized and saved out in the subdirectory
'trained'.  All other behaviors are defined in the "basic.behaviors" file.
