TARGETS are objects which can provide FEATURES.  For example, the feature
"Distance To" can be with respect to the target "closest obstacle", or to
the target "mouse pointer".

Certain targets are PARAMETERS.  These are special targets declared by
the user during training of a finite-state automaton behavior.  Parameters
are labelled "A", "B", or "C" (we have three of them right now).

After the FSA is trained and saved to disk, any parameters it uses are
changed to WRAPPERS.  A wrapper is a target which represents an argument
to the FSA.  When you load and use the FSA later, each wrapper must be
bound to some other target.  This is the procedure used to handle
the equivalent of function arguments in an FSA.

The remaining targets are GROUND TARGETS which specify an actual thing
like "closest obstacle" or "mouse pointer".  In general objects which
can be queried by targets to get information for features (like obstacles)
are TARGETABLE objects.

The default target is ME, which represents the agent itself.

All available targets are specified in the basic.targets file.
