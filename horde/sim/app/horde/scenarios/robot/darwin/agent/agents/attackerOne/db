### AGENT CLASS

class = sim.app.horde.scenarios.robot.darwin.agent.AttackerOneAgent

### TYPES
# I have defined two types already:
# global	Things that show up in every Horde agent
# sim		Things that show up in basic sim agents

# Here we state that we will use both global and sim types

num-types = 2
type.0 = global
type.1 = sim

#### If I were a homogeneous controller agent, I might say:
# class = sim.app.horde.agent.SimControllerAgent
# num-subs = 1
# sub.0 = foo
# sub.0.min = 1
# sub.0.max = 5
# sub.0.pref = 4
#### (foo is the name of a subsidiary agent type)
#### Additionally, if I wanted to force joint behaviors for
#### Every single behavior in the subsidiary, not just the
#### macros, I can say:
# all-behaviors = true

#### If I were a heterogeneous controller agent, I might say:
# class = sim.app.horde.agent.SimControllerAgent
# num-subs = 2
# sub.0 = foo
# sub.0.min = 1
# sub.0.max = 9
# sub.0.pref = 2
# sub.1 = bar
# sub.1.min = 4
# sub.1.max = 4
# sub.1.pref = 4
# num-joints = 3
# joint.0.name = attack-castle
# joint.0.does.0 = go-left
# joint.0.does.1 = go-right
# joint.1.name = circle-castle
# joint.1.does.0 = go-around
# joint.1.does.1 = wait
# joint.2.name = stop
# joint.2.does.0 = stop
# joint.2.does.1 = stop
