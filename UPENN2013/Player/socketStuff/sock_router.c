/* This is a socket mailbox.  It's all example code, but it's designed
 *  to be run like a daemon, always on in the background.
 * Your programs send TCP data to the port for this router and
 *  it will receive the packet, parse it, and store it
 *  for retrieval, based on the rules defined.
 *
 * General Design - 
 *   Main thread opens a socket for listening
 *   Listener thread actively listens for data, processes data,
 *     and stores data for later retrieval, or retrieves data (peek or pop)  
 *   When you enter 2 on the main thread, it will close the listener
 *     and shut down.  When you ctrl-C, same thing.
 *   When you enter 1 on the main thread, it will print the mailbox data
 *
 *   Is this multi-threaded design really needed?  Sort of.  It allows
 *     the program to close the port and make it immediately available.
 *     Killing the program without doing this leaves the port held by
 *     the OS until it times out, which can take a while.

   /* We'll start with the poll framework.

    * There are two basic models for managing a listener: thread and multiplexing
    *  1) Thread: This is very simple.  Every time you accept a connection, spawn a 
    *       brand new thread to manage it.  Have a dozen connections? 12 threads, plus
    *       the listener thread.  Plus the main thread.
    *  2) Multiplexing: This is also pretty simple.  You have one thread running the 
    *       listener.  When none of the watched sockets have activity, it blocks and
    *       removes itself from the CPU.  When any of the sockets has activity, it 
    *       unblocks, receives, processes, handles, and resumes blocking until new
    *       data arrives.  Can handle hundreds of simultaneous connections without
    *       breaking a sweat, all on one thread.  We're doing this one.
    *
    * The multiplexer I like is poll().  select() is an older, very common one too.  
    *  A newer, event-driven one is epoll, which is good beyond 1024 connections, but
    *    it's pretty complicated and is really only ideal for large numbers of connections.
    *
    * Poll takes 3 arguments.  The first is the set of file descriptors for connections you
    *   want to watch, then it takes the number of file descriptors to watch, finally there
    *   is a timeout for routine event handling during lulls in activity.
    *
    * If it works, it will return a non-negative integer for the number of file descriptors
    *   with pending activity.  0 is valid (used for timeout).  < 0 is bad.
